Road-User Behaviour Analysis Using AI &amp; Computer Vision (Project 49)

Run the following in either a code cell before the main code in Google Colab, or in your terminal:

pip install ultralytics supervision

If running Colab tests, upload /asset/ contents into your Drive Account, make sure to match the file paths in the code to your drive locations.

## The New Video

The new video file used for tracking and status detection is located in the `asset` folder:

📁 **Path**: `asset/videoplayback.mp4`

This video is used as the input for the vehicle detection, tracking, and stopping behavior analysis system.

> Ensure this file exists in the correct directory before running the script.
