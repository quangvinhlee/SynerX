  # Fix video_uploads RLS policy

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing ALL policy on video_uploads table
    - Create new policy to allow all inserts
    - Keep existing RLS enabled

  2. Security
    - Allows any authenticated user to insert rows
    - Backend (Edge Functions) will handle user validation
    - Maintains RLS but with looser insert policy
